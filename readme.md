# Rust Raytracer

This is a Rust implementation of a raytracer, based on the original [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. I am using this as a means to learn Rust.

## Description

A raytracer is a program that simulates the behavior of light in a virtual scene. It works by tracing the path of rays of light as they bounce off objects in the scene, until they reach the camera or a light source. The resulting image is a realistic rendering of the scene.

## Usage

To use this raytracer, you'll need to have [Rust install](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)ed on your system. You can then clone this repository and run the following command to build the project:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/your/raytracer
$ cargo run 
```
